\usage{
sortnum(x, decreasing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector where each word may contain a number}

\item{decreasing}{logical: Should the sort be increasing or decreasing?    Not
available for partial sorting.}
}
\value{
a sorted charcter vector
}
\description{
sort a vector of words numerically, as opposed to alphanumerically.
If your words contain a number, eg string1, string2, string3, ..., string10
then the standard sort would return string10, string1, string2, ...
and converting to numeric would fail.
