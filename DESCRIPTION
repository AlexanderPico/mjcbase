Title: General helper functions for dealing with \R objects/data types
Description: Various utilities designed to extend base functionality of \R, since 2004, including:
   - venn comparisons from 2, or 3 vectors: print.venn, write.venn
   - data import: read.table.fast, read.table.wide, readLine
   - data export: write.delim, write.delim.list, writeLines.list,
   - data summaries: percentile, quartile,
   - set operations: unionN, intersectN, unduplicate, interleave
   - clipboard interaction: pbpaste, pbcopy
   - converting lists, vectors and tables of n:n mappings,
   - file system interaction: dir.remove, dir.size, file.gzip, file.issymlink, file.move, file.numlines,
   - and many, many more.
   Some of this functionality will have been replaced over the years by the tidyverse,
   but still useful.
